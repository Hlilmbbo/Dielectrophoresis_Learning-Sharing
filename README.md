# Dielectrophoresis_Learning-Sharing
Personal learning sharing about Dielectrophoresis (DEP) in oil-water separation 

In the future, I will update and research the relevant content of dielectrophoresis in the field of oil-water separation here.

Specifically, in the field of oil-water separation, for W/O type emulsions, electrocoalescence technology is used to utilize the dielectrophoresis effect in non-uniform electric fields to achieve oil-water separation.
